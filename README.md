## General

This project was the result of a research endeavour into simulating intelligent decision making in chess. In the field of Game Theory a common approach to compute the best sequence of moves to maximize the odds of winning is to use the Minimax algorithm to minimize the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario.

### MiniMax

Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally. It is widely used in two player turn-based games such as Chess or Tic-Tac-Toe
In Minimax the two players are called maximizer and minimizer. The maximizer tries to get the highest score possible while the minimizer tries to do the opposite and get the lowest score possible.
Every board state has a value associated with it. In a given state if the maximizer has upper hand then, the score of the board will tend to be some positive value. If the minimizer has the upper hand in that board state then it will tend to be some negative value. The values of the board are calculated by some heuristics which are unique for every type of game.

### Evauation function

The evaluation function is used to assign a numerical value to a board state so that different board states that is a result of different sequence of moves could be compared by the MiniMax algorithm 

#### Factors that are considered
- Material
- Piece development

### Alpha-beta pruning
This is an optimization algorithm that greatly reduces the number of board states that bahve to be evaluated by removing board states that are obviously undesireble

## Lessons Learned

The engine evaluates every possible move up to six moves into the future. All the board states after the six moves are analyzed to determine which one has the highest probability of winning. By utilizing the MiniMax algorithm, the engine can then calculate which moves to make. The assumption is that the opposing player would also be making the optimal moves to ensure his/her victory. I then added the Alpha-beta pruning algorithm that reduces the number of board states to evaluate by removing those that are obviously unfavorable.
Evaluating any given board state is done with the use of an evaluation function. There are many ways to implement such a function, so my goal was to find one that balanced performance with accuracy. Performance is improved by reducing the number of parameters to process while accuracy is improved by increasing it. I set a 10 second limit to the processing time and then went on to find the most efficient evaluation function that I could. The one I finally came up with allowed the engine to evaluate 6 moves ahead.
